        <h2>Earth</h2>
        <p>Earth is rounded into an ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000 km. It is the densest planet in the
          Solar System. Of the four rocky planets, it is the largest and most massive.</p>

        <img src="./assets/planet1.png" alt="Planet 2">
        <h2>Mars</h2>
        <p>When the solar system settled into its current layout about 4.5 billion years ago, Mars formed when gravity
          pulled swirling gas and dust in to become the fourth planet from the Sun. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card5">
        <img src="./assets/planet2.png" alt="Planet 2">
        <h2>Venus</h2>
        <p>Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction from most planets. Venus is similar in structure and size to
          Earth, and is sometimes called Earth's evil twin. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card2">
        <img src="./assets/planet3.png" alt="Planet 2">
        <h2>Jupiter</h2>
        <p>It's the largest planet in our solar system. Jupiter also is the oldest planet, forming from the dust and
          gases left over from the Sun's formation 4.5 billion years ago. </p>

      <div class="card1">
        <img src="./assets/planet4.png" alt="Planet 2">
        <h2>Pluto</h2>
        <p>t's about 3.6 billion miles away from the Sun, and it has a thin atmosphere composed mostly of nitrogen,
          methane, and carbon monoxide.On average, Pluto's temperature is -387°F (-232°C), making it too cold to sustain
          life. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card3">
        <img src="./assets/planet5.png" alt="Planet 2">
        <h2>Neptune</h2>
        <p>Neptune is one of two ice giants in the outer solar system (the other is Uranus). Most (80% or more) of the
          planet's mass is made up of a hot dense fluid of "icy" materials – water, methane, and ammonia – above a
          small, rocky core. </p>

    <p class="paragraph">1- One million Earths could fit inside the Sun – and the Sun is considered an average-size
      star.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">2- There are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on all the beaches on Earth. That’s
      at least a billion trillion!</p>
    <p class="paragraph">3- Comets are leftovers from the creation of our solar system about 4.5 billion years ago –
      they consist of sand, ice and carbon dioxide.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">4- You wouldn’t be able to walk on Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus or Neptune because they have no
      solid surface!</p>
    <p class="paragraph">5- If you could fly a plane to Pluto, the trip would take more than 800 years!</p>
    <p class="paragraph">6- Mercury & Venus are the only 2 planets in our solar system that have no moons.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">7- If a star passes too close to a black hole, it can be torn apart.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">8- The hottest planet in our solar system is Venus.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">9- Our solar system is 4.57 billion years old.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">10- Enceladus, one of Saturn’s smaller moons, reflects 90% of the Sun’s light.</p>
